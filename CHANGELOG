Changelog
=========

Here you can see the full list of changs between each relaycommander release.

Version 0.0.13
--------------

Released on January 15, 2020

Core CLI:
  * Add feature to support updates for feature flags stored in DynamoDB using AWS boto3.

Developer Experience:
  * Add integration tests for DynamoDB.

Version 0.0.12
--------------

UNRELEASED

Core CLI:
  * Implement environment variable validator to ensure that required
    environment variables are set in the environment.
  * Implement helpers for version checking and logging.
  * Add try/except logic for all calls to the LaunchDarkly API. Any exceptions
    coming from the LaunchDarkly API were previously uncaught.

Developer Experience:
  * Add sphinx-click extension which allows us to automatically generate
    documentation for our click based CLI using sphinx.
  * Switch away from ``pipenv``. This was causing a few more problems than
    it was solving, so we moved back to using a standard virtualenv, pip,
    and requirements.txt file.
  * Refactor everything for `PEP-8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_
    and `PEP-484 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/>`_.

Version 0.0.11
--------------

Released on March 5, 2019

.. warning::
    This release fixes a critical bug where commands were not automatically
    being replayed via the CLI. All users are urged to upgrade to this version
    as soon as possible if it is being used in production.

* Refactor CLI to accept ``on`` or ``off`` instead of ``true`` or ``false``.
  This better aligns with the experience that a user would have if they were
  to flip a kill switch in the LaunchDarkly UI.
* Fix a critical bug where commands were not being replayed properly via
  the playback command.
* Add support for python 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7 - due to an upstream issue with
  swagger and python 3.7 we were not able to use the LD API wrapper in versions
  greater than 3.6. This is no longer the case.
* Add integration tests to test out the general flow of the run book on all
  supported python versions during CI.
* Add new command to generate a relay proxy configuration for a given project.

Version 0.0.10
--------------

Released on January 28, 2019

* Add feature that allows users to override the default redis port as
   a part of the configuration.

Version 0.0.9
-------------

Released on January 25, 2019

* Add feature to allow users to define multiple redis destinations. The CLI
  will then attempt to update all hosts and report back the status via the
  console.

.. warning::
    All of the versions below have been unpublished from pypi to reduce
    confusion. If you need a specific version from below you can download the
